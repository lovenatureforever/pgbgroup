        'description' => 'At PGB, well-defined sustainability governance structure is fundamental to achieving our long-term sustainability goals. It fosters accountability, strategic oversight and transparency, enabling us to effectively manage SROs across the Group.
Our governance structure is designed to systematically embed sustainability practices into decision-making processes, from strategic planning to operational execution. This approach ensures comprehensive oversight and effective implementation of sustainability initiatives at every level.
Following an internal audit of the sustainability management system, the internal auditor recommended enhancing the sustainability governance structure to improve efficiency and streamline reporting. In response, management initiated a restructuring process to consolidate sustainability risk oversight under the RMC. This change eliminates the Audit Committee ("AC") from the sustainability reporting line, reflecting the inherent link between sustainability risks and the Group\'s overall risk management. The revised structure has been approved by the Board on 29 May 2025, ensures that the Sustainability Steering Committee now directly reports to the RMC.
The following diagram illustrates the Group\'s revised sustainability governance structure, defining roles and responsibilities at every level to support effective decision-making and implementation.
Our governance structure supports continuous monitoring of sustainability practices. The SSC meets quarterly to discuss SROs, while the SWC conducts monthly reviews to track progress and implementation. Additionally, the RMC and the Board meet biannually to ensure strategic alignment and oversees the progress of sustainability initiatives.
By maintaining a clear and effective governance structure, we ensure that sustainability remains a core component of the Group\'s strategic and operational framework. This alignment between sustainability initiatives and risk management processes supports our commitment to responsible business practices and long-term value creation.',

        'description' => 'Engaging with stakeholders is fundamental to advancing our sustainability journey. Through ongoing collaboration with diverse stakeholder groups, we identify key concerns, develop responsive strategies and strengthen our sustainability practices. These engagements cultivate trust, improve transparency and strengthen relationships that support sustainable business growth.
We recognise our accountability to a diverse group of stakeholders - including individuals and groups directly impacted by our operations, as well as those who influence our business direction. These stakeholders were identified based on their levels of influence and dependence on the Group\'s activities

Stakeholder Engagement FY2025
In line with Bursa Securities SRG, we conduct regular reviews of our material matters, including limited-scale assessments and comprehensive full-scale exercises every three (3) years.
A stakeholder engagement survey was conducted from 9 April 2025 to 23 April 2025, involving both internal and external stakeholders. Although the number of invitees slightly declined (from 1,786 in 2023 to 1,771 in 2025), we recorded 82 responses, representing a 21% increase in the participation rate compared to the previous full-scale exercise.
The survey focused on evaluating the relative importance of the thirteen (13) material matters, categorised under the four (4) sustainability pillars. The results of the assessment reflect a recalibration in the prioritisation of matters to better represent current stakeholder expectations and emerging sustainability themes.
This comprehensive approach to stakeholder engagement underscores our commitment to inclusive and transparent practices. By continuously seeking diverse and representative feedback, we ensure that our sustainability strategy remains responsive to evolving stakeholder expectations and emerging challenges.',
